This project demonstrates the fundamentals of analog signal modulation and demodulation through a MATLAB-based graphical interface. It enables users to visualize Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase Modulation (AM, FM, PM) and their corresponding demodulated and reconstructed signals.

Using MATLABâ€™s GUI environment, the project provides an interactive platform where users can input signal parameters and instantly observe how modulation techniques affect waveform characteristics. The system illustrates real-time differences between message, carrier, and modulated signals, helping to understand core communication principles.
